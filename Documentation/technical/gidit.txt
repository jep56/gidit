git-gidit
=============

Overall operation
-----------------

. Generates PushObjects and other things needed by the gidit-daemon

. Stuff runs in git client, and calls gidit-daemon

Gidit Objects
-------------

The DHT cloud stores two main types of objects, PushObjects, and
bundles. 

PushObjects are looked up through a PGP key, and ProjectName. The PGP
key allows for unique identification of an individuals. The
ProjectName identifies an individuals branch. This lookup should
return all PushObjects for a given PGP key and ProjectName in sorted
order (older PushObjects later).

Bundles are looked up through a Start SHA1 and an End SHA1.


Storage Layout
--------------

Default base dir is '/var/gidit'

PushObjects, since they are looked up through PGP and ProjectName,
would be stored in files stored in folders by their PGP keys.

The file structure would be:

./pushobjects/SHA1 of PGP Key/ProjectName/PushObjSHA1

The ProjectName folder would hold the PushObjects. There is a special file in
this folder called HEAD which would hold the most recent PushObject's
SHA1. The SHA1 is calculated by the PushObject contents excluding the
pgp signature, (only the SHA1s and their references).

Bundles would be stored similar to how git stores objects. A folder 
of the two char SHA1 prefix, followed by a folder consisting of the 
rest of the SHA1 hash. The bundle would be stored inside of the folder 
with the name of the end SHA1.

./bundles/[PushObj Start SHA1]/[PushObj End SHA1]/[SHA1 of Bundle]

A special file called BUNDLES will hold a pointer to the file, this is needed
for security, slated for later. Under current implementation, it is trivial to 
overwrite the bundle with a bad one. Future improvement invovles PGP signed
bundles.


PushObjects
-----------

A PushObject is simply a snapshot of a repository (including all
relevant refs) during a push. It holds a list of SHA1s for each
tag/branch being pushed.

An example of the contents of a saved PushObject:

	bf562635643c29adb3bae3057c0f01403994b17c HEAD
	616c9272a6b2125d224ffc9ecabdaf07f9afffa9 refs/heads/master
	bf562635643c29adb3bae3057c0f01403994b17c refs/heads/po_store
	616c9272a6b2125d224ffc9ecabdaf07f9afffa9 refs/heads/pushobj
	616c9272a6b2125d224ffc9ecabdaf07f9afffa9 refs/heads/working

	522a47cd385352ae03f2c3ef44eae561c1cf3af6 PREV

The line with PREV is all 0's if it is the first pushobject.

PushObjects, went sent over the wire, do not have the PREV either.
