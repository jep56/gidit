git-gidit-daemon
=============

Overall operation
-----------------

. Connects to the gidit cloud and handles bundle send/receiving

. Learns what refs the cloud has and what is needed, pulls in 
  what is needed, and forwards off to the git client.

. Daemon runs, and participates in cloud operations while 
  waiting for actions from local git clients.

. Called by git client and provides shim between it and the chimera DHT

Client-Daemon Operations
------------------------

. proj-init

	Initializes a user's gidit project directory. This involves saving their public PGP
	key as well, if it does not already exist.

	Format is:
	[projname]\n[pgp public key]

	Can be accessed through:
	echo -n <stuff> | git gidit --proj-init -b /path/to/gidit/

	pgp key is the binary output, equivalent to gpg --export

. updatepl

	Updates the pushobject list by creating a new head.

	PushObjects when sent off from client to daemon are in this form:
	[sha1 of pgpkey][projname]\n[signed pushobject]

	The [sha1 of pgpkey] is the binary output of your pgpkey sha1'd,
	equivalent to `gpg --export [id] | sha1sum`.

	This can be invoked with:
	echo -n <stuff> | git gidit --updatepl -b /var/gidit/
